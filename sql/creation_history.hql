-- Query to extract all main namespace page creation events made on the
-- English Wikipedia. This query is based on
-- https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T149021#3281771
-- but adapted to remove current redirects and use improved redirect
-- detection, both mentioned later in the same Phabricator task. It has
-- also been modified to not ignore deleted articles.
-- Note: this does not identify articles published by moving them into
-- the main namespace from other namespaces.
